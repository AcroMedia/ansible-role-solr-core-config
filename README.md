# ansible-role-solr-core-config

![.github/workflows/molecule.yml](https://github.com/AcroMedia/ansible-role-solr-core-config/workflows/.github/workflows/molecule.yml/badge.svg)

Copy a config set from an arbitrary location (ie one that ships with the solr drupal module) into the solr core's config directory.

This is meant to be used in conjunction with (and after both of) GeerlingGuy's solr role, and Acro Media's virtual host role.

**Warning**: All of the contents of  `/{{ solr_home }}/data/{{ solr_core_name }}/conf` will be replaced by the contents of `{{ solr_core_conf_source }}`. If you want your conf dir backed up, you'll need to do that before running this role.


## Requirements

* Your source core conf files must already be in place on the server. Drupal 7 config can be obtained from the search api module. Drupal 8 solr config must be generated by Drupal (which seems awkward, because it is). Either way, commit your solr config files and deploy them to your server before you use this role. 
* Your solr core must already exist. If you're using [GeerlingGuy's solr role](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-solr), then list your core name as one of the items in the `solr_cores` variable. Or create your core manually in the Solr UI. Or run the solr cli to create your core. Once your core is created, the directory specified by `solr_core_conf_dest` will exist, and this role can do its job.


## Role Variables

### Required:
* **solr_core_conf_source**: Absolute path to the directory on the server that contains your config set
* **solr_core_name**: Name of the solr core that the conf files will be attached to

### Optional:
* **solr_service_name**: In case your solr service is named something other than `solr`.
* **solr_home**: In case your solr files were configured somewhere other than `/var/solr`
* **solr_core_conf_dest**: Defaults to `"{{ solr_home }}/data/{{ solr_core_name }}/conf"`. You shouldn't ever need to change this. It's only noted here, because it's very easy to miss creating your core before using t his role. This role does not create the solr core for you.
