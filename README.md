# ansible-role-solr-core-config

![.github/workflows/molecule.yml](https://github.com/AcroMedia/ansible-role-solr-core-config/workflows/.github/workflows/molecule.yml/badge.svg)

Copy a config set from an arbitrary location into Solr's core config directory, and apply the correct ownership + permissions.

This is meant to be used in conjunction with (and after both of) GeerlingGuy's solr role, and Acro Media's virtual host role.

**Warning**: All of the contents of  `/{{ solr_home }}/data/{{ solr_core_name }}/conf` will be replaced by the contents of `{{ solr_core_conf_source }}`. If you want your conf dir backed up, you'll need to do that before running this role.


## Requirements

* **Your source core conf files must already be in place on the server**
    * Drupal 7 config can be obtained from the search api module. 
    * Drupal 8 solr config must be generated by Drupal (which seems awkward, because it is). 
    * Either way, commit your solr config files and deploy them to your server before you use this role. 
* **Your solr core must already exist**. 
    * If you're using [GeerlingGuy's solr role](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-solr), then list your core name as one of the items in the `solr_cores` variable. Or create your core manually in the Solr UI. Or run the solr cli to create your core. Once your core is created, the directory specified by `solr_core_conf_dest` will exist, and this role can do its job.


## Role Variables

### Required:
* **solr_core_conf_source**: Absolute path to the directory on the server that contains your config set
* **solr_core_name**: Name of the solr core that the conf files will be attached to

### Optional:
* **solr_service_name**: In case your solr service is named something other than `solr`.
* **solr_home**: In case your solr files were configured somewhere other than `/var/solr`
* **solr_core_conf_dest**: Defaults to `"{{ solr_home }}/data/{{ solr_core_name }}/conf"`. You shouldn't ever need to change this. It's only noted here, because it's very easy to miss creating your core before using t his role. This role does not create the solr core for you. See the [Requirements](#Requirements) section above.

## Example Playbooks

```yaml
    - hosts: web_servers
      become: true 
      gather_facts: true
      roles:
        - name: Install Solr 8 for use by my Drupal 9 site
          role: geerlingguy.solr 
          solr_cores: 
           - siteXYZcore
           
        - name: Configure my drupal 9 site 
          role: acromedia.virtual-host 
          #  ... etc etc etc... 

        - name: Configure the solr core for my D9 site, whose config I generated from my local lando dev environment, and then deployed to my server.
          role: acromedia.solr-core-config
          vars:
            solr_core_conf_source: /var/www/vhosts/siteXYZ/src/solr_conf
            solr_core_name: siteXYZcore

    # When using the same role more than once in the same playbook, it's safest to separate them into thier own plays.
    - hosts: web_servers  
      become: true 
      gather_facts: true
      roles:
        - name: Install solr 6 alongside the default solr 6 install, to support my Drupal 7 site
          role: geerlingguy.solr 
          solr_version: "6.6.6"
          solr_service_name: solr6
          solr_port: "8986"
          solr_home: "/var/{{ solr_service_name }}"
          solr_cores: 
           - mySolr6core

        - name: Configure my drupal 7 site 
          role: acromedia.virtual-host 
          #  ... etc etc etc... 
          
        - name: Configure solr core for my D7 site, whose config comes from the search_api_solr module.
          role: acromedia.solr-core-config
          vars:
            solr_core_conf_source: /var/www/vhosts/siteABC/public_html/modules/contrib/search_api_solr/solr-conf/6.x
            solr_core_name: mySolr6core
